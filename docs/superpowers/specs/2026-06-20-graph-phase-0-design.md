# Graph Memory — Phase 0 Design (store + serialization)

**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Status:** Design, awaiting approval
**Parent spec:** [`docs/REM-memory-architecture-spec.md`](../../REM-memory-architecture-spec.md) §4, §8, §10
**Phase gate (from parent §10):** "Build a graph by hand, serialize it to context,
run a query against it, get the correct currently-valid edges back, deterministically."

## 1. Goal and scope

Build the data substrate for the graph-resident memory: a temporal graph store
whose edges are facts, with supersession expressed as data (not a prompt
instruction) and a deterministic, model-free serialization into context text.

This is Phase 0 only. It is unit-tested, with **no models and no dataset**. It is
the foundation the later read path (Phase 1) and write path (Phase 2) build on.

Building this now is deliberately ahead of the gate decision: the architecture
spec selects the graph only if the tight-budget battery shows summary/stale-ghost/
read-path failures dominate. Phase 0 is low-risk and reusable regardless, and it
does not touch the current compaction path (the system under test).

## 2. Non-goals (explicitly deferred)

- **Embeddings / entity resolution by meaning** → Phase 1+. Phase 0 dedups nodes
  by exact label only. The `embedding` fields exist on the model but stay `None`.
- **Retrieval (vector / BM25 / traversal / ranking)** → Phase 1.
- **Worker extraction, overflow buffer, ingestion** → Phase 2.
- **Persistence / backend choice** (SQLite, graph db) → later. Phase 0 is
  in-memory behind a clean store interface so a backend can swap in without
  touching callers.
- **Relation normalization / controlled vocabulary** → freeform predicates for now.

## 3. Module layout

New package `src/rem/graph/`, three focused modules (pydantic models, matching
`src/rem/memory/tiers.py` conventions):

| Module | Responsibility | Public surface |
|---|---|---|
| `model.py` | Data model | `Node`, `Edge` |
| `store.py` | Store + supersession + temporal queries | `GraphStore` |
| `serialize.py` | Currently-valid edges → context text | `serialize_edges`, `serialize_current` |

## 4. Data model (`model.py`)

`Node` (entity):
- `id: str` — stable internal id (auto `uuid4().hex` if not supplied)
- `label: str` — canonical display string
- `aliases: list[str] = []` — observed surface forms
- `embedding: list[float] | None = None` — Phase 0: always None
- `created_at: float` — `default_factory=time`

`Edge` (one fact):
- `id: str` — auto `uuid4().hex` if not supplied
- `subject_id: str` — a node id
- `relation: str` — predicate string (freeform)
- object as a validated **one-of**:
  - `object_id: str | None = None` — node id, when the object is an entity
  - `object_literal: str | None = None` — literal value (string/number/date as string)
  - validator: exactly one of the two is non-null
- event timeline:
  - `valid_from: float` — when the fact became true (epoch)
  - `valid_to: float | None = None` — when it stopped being true; None = still true
- transaction timeline:
  - `ingested_at: float` — `default_factory=time`; when the system learned it
  - `invalidated_at: float | None = None` — when the system learned it ended; None = still believed
- `source_turn_id: int | None = None` — provenance
- `kind: Literal["entity", "number", "decision", "quote"] = "entity"`
- `embedding: list[float] | None = None` — Phase 0: always None

Temporal fields are floats for clean, deterministic ordering. A tiny test helper
may convert ISO dates → epoch; production callers (Phase 2) supply timestamps.

## 5. Store + supersession (`store.py`)

`GraphStore` holds `nodes: dict[str, Node]` and `edges: list[Edge]` in memory.

Methods:
- `add_node(node) -> Node` / `ensure_node(label, aliases=()) -> Node` — dedup by
  exact label (case-insensitive); record new surface forms as aliases.
- `get_node(node_id) -> Node | None`
- `add(edge, *, supersede=True) -> Edge` — apply supersession (below), then insert.
- `current_edges() -> list[Edge]` — `valid_to is None and invalidated_at is None`.
- `state_at_event_time(t: float) -> list[Edge]` — facts true at event time `t`,
  a pure event-timeline query: `valid_from <= t and (valid_to is None or t < valid_to)`.
  It must NOT filter on `invalidated_at`: a superseded fact was still true during
  its validity window even though it is no longer currently believed, and mixing
  in the transaction timeline here would hide history (and contradict the
  old-before/new-after supersession behavior).
- `belief_at_transaction_time(t: float) -> list[Edge]` — what the system believed
  at transaction time `t`: `ingested_at <= t and (invalidated_at is None or t < invalidated_at)`.

### 5.1 Supersession (parent §4.3, with one decision)

On `add(new_edge)` with `supersede=True`: find currently-valid edges with the same
`(subject_id, relation)`.
- If an existing valid edge has a **different** object → close it, then insert the new edge.
- If the object is **identical** → skip the insert (no-op).
- Otherwise → insert the new edge.

> **DECISION — deviation from parent §4.3 (needs sign-off).**
> The parent spec says close the old edge by setting both `valid_to` *and*
> `invalidated_at` to the new edge's `valid_from`. But those are different
> timelines: `valid_to` is event time (when the fact stopped being true),
> `invalidated_at` is transaction time (when we *learned* it changed). Setting
> `invalidated_at` to `valid_from` makes "what did we believe at transaction
> time T" queries wrong. This design sets:
> - `old.valid_to = new.valid_from` (event time), and
> - `old.invalidated_at = new.ingested_at` (transaction time).
>
> This is the principled bitemporal model and is what makes both point-in-time
> queries correct — the reason we chose to include point-in-time at all. If you
> prefer strict spec fidelity, we set both to `new.valid_from` instead and accept
> that transaction-time queries are not meaningful in Phase 0.

## 6. Serialization (`serialize.py`)

`serialize_edges(edges, resolve_label) -> str` and a convenience
`serialize_current(store) -> str`.

- One fact per line, currently-valid edges only by default.
- Resolve `subject_id`/`object_id` to node labels via the store; render
  `object_literal` verbatim.
- Format: `<subject_label> <relation> <object>`, with an optional `(since <iso-date>)`
  suffix derived from `valid_from` when present.
- Token cost reported via the existing `rem.memory.tiers.count_tokens` (the
  serialized form is the budget that matters, per parent §4.4).

Example output:
```text
user lives_in Denver (since 2024-03)
rem target_hw strix_halo
invoice.q3 owner billing_team
```

## 7. Testing strategy

Unit tests per module, no models, fully deterministic:
- `model.py`: one-of object validator (rejects both-set and neither-set); id/timestamp defaults.
- `store.py`: node dedup + aliases; supersession (different object closes old,
  identical object is a no-op); `current_edges`; `state_at_event_time` returns the
  old value before the update timestamp and the new value after;
  `belief_at_transaction_time` reflects the bitemporal decision.
- `serialize.py`: label resolution, literal rendering, `(since …)` suffix, token count.

**Phase 0 gate test** (end-to-end, the parent §10 gate): hand-build a small graph,
apply a supersession, assert `current_edges()` and `state_at_event_time()` give
old-before / new-after, and that serialization matches expected lines exactly.

## 8. Acceptance criteria

- The package exists with the three modules and their public surface.
- All unit tests pass; the Phase 0 gate test passes deterministically.
- No dependency on any model or dataset; nothing imports from the current
  compaction path (and vice versa).

## 9. Alternatives kept open

These are viable roads not taken in Phase 0. Recorded so we can switch
deliberately rather than rediscover them. None block Phase 0; the clean store
interface and pydantic models are chosen partly to keep these cheap to adopt.

| Decision | Phase 0 choice | Viable alternatives | Revisit when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | In-memory (dicts/list) behind a store interface | SQLite edge table; embedded graph store (NetworkX, Kùzu, DuckDB-PGQ) | Phase 0 needs persistence, or edge volume / traversal cost outgrows lists |
| **Supersession timeline** (§5.1) | `invalidated_at = new.ingested_at` (principled bitemporal) | Strict parent-spec (`= new.valid_from`); append-only belief log (never mutate old edges) | A consumer needs strict spec parity, or we want full audit immutability |
| **Object representation** | One-of `object_id` xor `object_literal` (literal as string) | Tagged union `{kind, value}`; typed literals (number/date as real types); reify every literal as a value-node | Literal typing matters for ranking/comparison, or queries need typed math/date ops |
| **Temporal field type** | `float` epoch | ISO-8601 strings; `datetime`; integer logical clock | Human-readable storage or calendar-aware queries become important |
| **Node dedup** | Exact label, case-insensitive, first-seen canonical | Embedding similarity threshold (Phase 1); alias table; normalization (stemming/lowercasing) | Phase 1 entity resolution lands, or fragmentation hurts recall |
| **Relation vocabulary** | Freeform predicates | Controlled vocabulary; relation normalization / aliases (parent §11) | Synonymous relations fragment retrieval |
| **`state_at_event_time` semantics** | Current-beliefs filter (`invalidated_at is None`) | Full bitemporal as-of query (event time T *and* transaction time S) | A test/consumer needs "what we believed at S about T" |
| **Module decomposition** | 3 modules (`model`/`store`/`serialize`) | Single module; merge `model`+`store` | A module stays trivially small or boundaries prove artificial |
